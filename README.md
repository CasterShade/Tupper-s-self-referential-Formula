# Tupper-s-self-referential-Formula

#### One of the most unique different kind of formula to exist at the intersection of programing and mathematics 

The Formula is itself a function that is a universal plot. Finding the postion on Y axis where that plot exist is the only thing to be done from `https://keelyhill.github.io/tuppers-formula/`

Now, the above plot exists at exactly 

`k = 2009438748015460845581953502046539728995316656123463835348996604740778286067398208949500309731633627958305701873149144754591250337172089946048902436007969973550525841855184930578945009184686902386357207791583552848052009099506849277446683568577252715853116812240193556831799372704433641719181094824693896957462716650352894639225287921060651968663048975599826114718297793185518218105417058928621494290590148832506978213035217136175809099692520135773643651897953145689894173689165042868912879939343989505387870534917685248`


This repository hosts a code that calculates and plots the following formula for a particular value of k:


![image](https://github.com/CasterShade/Tupper-s-self-referential-Formula/blob/main/tuppers%20self%20referential%20formula.png)

Where k is the y value at which we are Graphing the set of points `(x,y) in 0 <= x < 106 and k <= y < k+17` using the inequality above.


It is really interesting that you could really have such a formula that has plot of everything in it. 

#### Note: You just need to know where it is. There's one site that helps find value of y i.e. k value where that plot exists on the Y axis of the plot of this formula. You just need to use that site to draw the plot and get the value of k.
